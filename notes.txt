Goals:
					COMPLETE:
					-Kavita requires a volume description of the parent folder of the images
						- certain manga will already have said delineation, while others dont
						- (ex. Tower of god has seasons which count, chainsaw man does not)
						- How do I determine if the manga already has some type of volume delineation?
						- make sure they do have said delineation if they do not
						- cheap, possibly naieve solution would be to check if the "Chapter" item that was scraped had some sort of hyphen in it, if it does, we can assume a delineation for volumes or seasons, if not we add one?
					DONE - the naieve solution seems to be working for now, so I will keep it as is.

-PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO MORE ERROR CHECKING AND DATA VALIDATION

-Add support for other sources (mangakalot - something that I required from my previous tachiyomi library), I wonder if this would require a rewrite...
Thoughts on implementation:
	Sites will both have different grab points for data, elements/css attributes/data attributes on elements
	Either have the user select the source, then search for the reading material OR search both websites and present the results to the user for them to choose
	Split mangasee123.com implementation and mangakalot implementation into their own handlers, helpers, methods to be used when we want something from either Sites

-Update manga will update mangaData.json data
	- user will select update data and we can update manga entries that haven't been updated in x period of time
	- check if new information is different from previous information

-Automatically move the scraped files to my nas under the reader's (Kavita's) shared folders
	-Check Manga Folder on D: drive, if folders exist, verify they have data in them
	- Migrate to either new or existing folder
	-Delete folders after move is sucessful

-Finally ensure we don't get blocked or overload their CDN or website by adding more appropriate checks and delays
	-So far so good I've been enjoying reading all my new manga/manhwa/comics :D
	Then I can enjoy my new full Kavita library with my own stored manga/manhwa/comics, maybe even setup a reverse proxy for out-network viewing for when I leave the house




SEPERATION NOTES:
	Search manga - user asks for a specific book, search both sources, when user decides on source take the branch of that source
	[mangasee]-[mangakakalot]
		/	 		\
	using the specified tools to assist in scraping based on the chosen source

	Current Create entry can be generalized to just be passed cleaned data and make an entry, which will be served by the specific source function(s)
		-Getting basic info, and cleaning it will be specialized
	Insert to file is as generalized as it can be. Used only when CreateEntry is called

	Update entry can be generalized: select book to update -> call specialized function for the source the book belongs to, recieve and clean information, then proceed with the normal update via end of update entry
		-Getting new info, cleaning info will be specialized
		-Not sure if mangakakalot will be able to be scraped the same way, the CDN automatically blocks any IP that attempts to open their image links through a browser
		-Not sure if its because of referer being missing when opening the link seperately, will test to verify later.
