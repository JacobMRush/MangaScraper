Goals:

-Kavita requires a volume description of the parent folder of the images
	- certain manga will already have said delineation, while others dont
	- (ex. Tower of god has seasons which count, chainsaw man does not)
	- How do I determine if the manga already has some type of volume delineation?
	- make sure they do have said delineation if they do not

-Update manga will update mangaData.json data
	- user will select update data and we can update manga entries that haven't been updated in x period of time


-Finally ensure we don't get blocked or overload their CDN or website by adding more appropriate checks and delays

Then I can enjoy my new full Kavita library with my own stored manga/manhwa/comics :D
